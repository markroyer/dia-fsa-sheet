# dia-fsa-sheet

A *very simple* sheet extension for finite state machines in Dia.

## Setup

First make sure that you have Dia installed.  On Debian you just need
to install the `dia` package.  Sourceforge also hosts
[Dia Document Editor](http://sourceforge.net/projects/dia-installer/files/)
for download.

Copy the files in the `sheets` and `shapes` directories to your local
user Dia directories.  On most Linux distributions, these files are in
the `~/.dia/sheets` and `~/.dia/shapes` locations.

Once the files are successfully copied, the new **FSA** sheet will
appear in the list of available sheets.

## Usage

The sheet contains the following two new shapes to help create FSA diagrams.

1. FSA - State
2. FSA - State Accepting

The initial state can be indicated by turning a State green (#00FF00).

The UML transition arrows can be used for state transitions.
